## <a name="overview"></a> üìù Overview

The **AI Surgical Assistant** is an innovative AI-powered system designed to assist surgeons throughout the entire surgical process: **pre-surgery**, **during surgery**, and **post-surgery**. It provides real-time guidance, automates critical tasks like report generation, and reduces the risks of surgical errors through voice-activated commands.

Surgeons can interact with the system using customizable wake-up phrases and receive immediate, actionable feedback to ensure optimal patient outcomes.

### Why it matters:
- **Surgical errors** are one of the leading causes of complications in the operating room.
- Our system helps mitigate human performance deficiencies by providing critical, data-driven insights in real time.
