Revolutionizing Surgery with Artificial Intelligence

The AI Surgical Assistant is designed to support surgeons before, during, and after surgical procedures by providing real-time guidance, automating report generation, and reducing the risk of human errors. With advanced AI integration, this system seamlessly interacts with the surgeon through voice commands, empowering healthcare professionals to focus on patient outcomes and precision.

🚀 Project Overview
Our AI Surgical Assistant enhances the entire surgical process by automating key tasks:

Pre-Surgery: The system generates a comprehensive report based on the surgery name, patient prescription, test reports, and scan results.
During Surgery: Surgeons can ask real-time questions via voice activation without the need for manual input. The assistant responds with relevant information to guide the procedure.
Post-Surgery: All gathered data, including surgeon conversations and procedure details, are compiled into a final report, offering critical insights on patient conditions and surgery outcomes.

🧠 Key Features
Voice-Activated Queries: Surgeons can interact with the system hands-free during surgery by using customizable wake-up phrases like “I have a question.” After queries are answered, the session can be closed with “That’s it.”
Pre-Surgery Report Generation: Automates the creation of surgery preparation reports based on patient data and medical history.
Customizable Wake-Up Words: Tailor the voice commands for specific scenarios or personal preferences.
Post-Surgery Reporting: The system generates a detailed post-op report based on the surgery process and patient status, reducing manual documentation.

⚠️ Problem Solved
Surgical errors and human performance deficiencies are a major contributor to life-threatening complications in the operating room. With medical errors accounting for $17 billion annually and 35% of these errors being surgery-related, our AI Assistant helps mitigate these risks by offering real-time guidance and automating critical tasks.


Statistics that highlight the issue:

50% of adverse events during surgeries are due to human errors (Baylor College of Medicine).
371,000 deaths and 424,000 permanent disabilities occur annually in the U.S. alone due to diagnostic and surgical errors (JAMA Network).
75% of lawsuits against surgeons result from intraoperative errors.
Our AI Surgical Assistant addresses these problems by providing actionable insights and real-time feedback, helping surgeons prevent critical errors and save lives.

🏥 Real-World Impact
Improved Surgical Outcomes: Reduced surgical complications through real-time AI-driven guidance.
Cost Efficiency: Minimized financial burden on hospitals by reducing preventable medical errors.
Enhanced Patient Safety: By eliminating human performance deficiencies, the system ensures higher patient safety.

🌐 How It Works
Pre-Surgery: The system collects and processes patient data (prescriptions, test reports, scans) to generate a detailed report.
During Surgery: The AI answers questions, provides guidance, and ensures the surgeon stays focused on the procedure through voice activation.
Post-Surgery: The assistant compiles surgery details into a final report that includes surgeon conversations, patient conditions, and procedure outcomes.

💻 Technologies Used
AI Model Integration: LangChain, RAG concept, and AI agents
Voice Activation System: Seamless hands-free interaction using customizable voice commands
Real-Time Feedback: Immediate responses to surgical queries
Report Automation: Pre- and post-surgery documentation generation

🎯 Future Directions
