## <a name="about-the-project"></a> üìù About the Project

The **AI Surgical Assistant** is an advanced AI-driven system designed to support surgeons through every phase of surgery: pre-surgery, during surgery, and post-surgery. This tool provides real-time guidance, automates report generation, and aims to reduce human errors through voice-activated commands.
